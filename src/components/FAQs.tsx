        question="What is a smart contract?"
        answer={
          <span>
            <strong>A smart contract</strong> is a computer program or a
            transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute,
            control or document events and actions according to the terms of a
            contract or an agreement.

              transparent, immutable, and can be executed automatically,
            </strong>{" "}
            which can reduce transaction times, minimize the need for
            intermediaries, and lower costs.

        answer={
          <span>
            Yes, we use AI in our smart contract development process to automate
            certain tasks and improve efficiency. This includes using{" "}
            <strong>machine learning</strong> to analyze data and predict how
            the contract will behave once deployed, and using{" "}
            <strong>natural language processing</strong> to analyze smart
            contract code and generate better tests and documentation for the
            contracts.
            <br /> <br />
            While AI is a helpful tool, we still rely on{" "}

            our clients' needs and is <strong>of the highest quality.</strong>
